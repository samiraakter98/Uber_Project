# Uber_Project
This project is a complete implementation of Uber's user-side operations, developed as part of a database course. It allows users to book rides, track drivers, and view routes from the pickup point to the destination using an interactive map. The app includes features like ride selection, fare estimation, and location-based services, as well as simulating tracking and providing a user-friendly experience. The project emphasizes the integration of database operations with location-based services, showcasing key functionalities of a ride-hailing app.
